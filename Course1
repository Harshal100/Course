Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis involves evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity, aiming to understand, compare, and choose the most efficient algorithms for specific tasks. It utilizes notations like Big O to express the growth rate and considers worst-case, average-case, and best-case scenarios
